# Description

The Google Book Search Engine was created using the MERN stack! With a React front end, MongoDB database, and a Node.js & Express.js server. It's set up to allow users to save book searches to their profile and view the books along with their details. 

The application is built using Google Books API so that users can click on a link that takes them to google books! The Book Search Engine is built with GraphQL API and Apollo Server.
